## At this point we have some still obfuscated JS and some strange image links in the CSS

We'll come back to the image sources, but let's look into the JS first.

It's still pretty nasty to look at so I've run it through https://deobfuscate.io/ and then https://beautifier.io/ and put it in it's own file.

[Prettified JS](/examples/example1/prettified.js)

It's all contained in an anonymous function that will be executed automatically on loading the page. To see what actually happening we'll walk through it.

The first thing I see is defining a global (window.) dictionary called "_cf_chl_opt" with a bunch of weirdly name properties, and it seems to add a few more later, outside of the initial declaration.

Looking a little closer we can see some of the properties and values aren't as cryptic as they seemed at first glance.
- cZone: "cutt.ly" | a url shortening service that it will probably reach out to for more JS
- cHash: "7d2baf93083d0cb" | some kind of hash? key??
- cT: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1e3) | The time the site is visited

At this point I remembered hearing about using AI tools to summarize obfuscated code, so I threw in ChatGPT to see what it could tell me. (ChatGPT is definitely not the best tool for this, there are now models trained for exactly this pupose, but ChatGPT is free...)

While not super helpful for things we didn't immediately know there was a useful snippet 
> "It creates a script element (cpo)"
> "it appends the dynamically created script element to the head"

Creating a new script element is one of a variety of methods to get the next block of JS to the client while keeping it off the website content. (I think this is to prevent/delay being flagged as a malicious site in general, and/or to make it harder to reverse? An actual need for
