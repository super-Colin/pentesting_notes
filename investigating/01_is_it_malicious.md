Is it malicious?

Do a quick google of the url without the .com, if nothing or only wierd results show up then keep reading, but know that there are some legitimate sites/services that may be using weird looking URL's


Just to be safe, let's cURL it and find out! 
- Ideally through a VPN

curl {URL/IP} -o output.html
-o to save the response to a file fo furthur investigation

At first glance it's clearly been minified at least, so save your eyes and deminify it; For this example I'm trying out https://unminify.com/

[Un-minified](/examples/example1/un_minified.html)

First glance notes:
- There's a lot of CSS at the top
- There are some images linking to some obfuscated urls as a source
- - - This is a big hint that the content is malicious in nature

- There's a huge obfuscated JS script at the bottom
- The body of the HTML document is one line that says "Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue"
- - a normal site may require JS but it wouldn't be obfuscated like this
- - - This is definitely malicious

### So we'll continue investigating with a reasonable certainty of ill intentions
