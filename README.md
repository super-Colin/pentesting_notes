# These are notes from my journey learning pentesting
# Everything here is own words, from my own research

## I do NOT condone any illegal behavior based on my notes..

Most of the scenarios I'll be exploring here will be from the perspective of trying to gather informatiion about a potentially malicious agent, with a strong focus on staying as anonymous as possible to the target.

The scope of my invesigations into staying anonymous are only related to the target, and assuming a "mid-level" equipped threat actor at most; My goal is not to stay 100% anonymous from a nation state level actor, and is guaranteed to not be enough to stay completely anonymous from your own government/ISP if they get involved.

I will also try to make some notes about defending from the penetration methods discussed.
