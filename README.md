# These are notes from my journey learning pentesting. Everything here is own words, from my own research

Most of the scenarios I'll be exploring here will be from the perspective of trying to gather informatiion about a potentially malicious agent, with a strong focus on staying as anonymous as possible to the target.

The scope of my invesigations into staying anonymous are only related to the target, and assuming a "mid-level" equipped threat actor at most; My goal is not to stay 100% anonymous from a nation state level actor, and is guaranteed to not be enough to stay completely anonymous from your own government/ISP if they get involved.

I will also try to make some notes about defending from the penetration methods discussed.

### I do NOT condone any illegal behavior, this is intended for informational references
