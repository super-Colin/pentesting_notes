How to hide your IP while nmap'ing?

Tor? Proxy?

https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/120708/nmap-through-proxy/120723#120723

There are limits to what types of packets can be over these (Tor/Proxies) protocols

Solution: Idle scanning

https://nmap.org/book/idlescan.html
nmap -Pn -p- -sI kiosk.adobe.com www.riaa.com
-Pn "No initial ping" !Important here!
-p- "All 65k ports"
-sI "Idle scan, uses the zombie"

!!! Do NOT use -sV this will expose your location

using a zombie host as the IP that makes connections to target
