### Bare Minimums

In order to install packages not included by default we will have to [admin password](https://tails.net/doc/first_steps/welcome_screen/administration_password/?ref=blog.zanshindojo.org).


### Preferences

I'm using persistant storage to keep some settings that I don't want to have to reset everytime, such as large text and a dark terminal theme. I'll also go ahead and save packages there so they don't need to be downloaded everytime.

Thanks to [this post](https://blog.zanshindojo.org/persisting-settings-to-tails/) for the example, but here's the snippets, run them after making all the changes you want to persist.

```
// make a config folder on persistent drive 
mkdir -pv /live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/dotfiles/.config/dconf
```

```
// copy the current settings to persistent file
cp ~/.config/dconf/user /live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/dotfiles/.config/dconf/
```

This led to an issue with [time synchronization](https://tails.net/contribute/design/Time_syncing/), which prevented connected to Tor without manually setting the date and time.

#### (Not worth it..)
After spending an entire Sunday trying to save a dark terminal background and some larger text, there were just too many errors caused by copying the dconf onto the persistent storage.
